## Preparation
The Preparation section will prevent you from losing important files, documents, and application keys upon reinstalling OSX. The hard drive is completely erased during this process and taking the time to back up files and deauthorizing applications will ensure you have zero regrets after your phresh install.

</br>

### 1. Back Up
A fresh install of OS X will wipe any files, programs, and documents from your hard drive. Whether you use Time Machine, the Cloud, or an external hard drive, be sure to have a back up of anything you will need on your phresh machine. If you are using the cloud, make sure all files are finished syncing as well.

### 2. Deauthorize  
Your computer will be viewed as a new machine after the phresh install, which means that you will want to deauthorize any applications that required a registration key. Otherwise, the same key will not work when registering a product after the wipe and you might have to jump through hoops to get your product license back.

## Wipe + Reinstall
The Wipe + Reinstall section will walk you through installing a phresh copy of OSX. When you are ready, you'll erase your hard drive and install the latest version of OSX. Once you are at this point, there is no going back so make sure you thoroughly check you have backed up all necessary files, documents, pictures, videos and deauthorized any applications (as mentioned in the previous steps).

</br>

### 1. Wipe
You will be erasing your hard drive at this point. This is the point of no return. Take a deep breath and commence.
